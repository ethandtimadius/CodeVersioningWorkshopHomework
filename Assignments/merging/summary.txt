Merging in Git refers to the process of combining changes from one branch (often called the "source" branch) into another branch (often called the "target" branch). When you merge branches in Git, the changes from the source branch are incorporated into the target branch, allowing you to integrate new features, bug fixes, or updates into the main line of development.
